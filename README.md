## About
A simple, minimal, entity-component based engine/framework aimed at learning and experiment with different concept in real time 3D programming. Current feature list includes:
- Custom model and texture loading.
- Custom scene loading from disk.
- Automatic per-vertex normal generation for missing normals.
- Custom shaders including ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting.
- First person camera support.
- Arc ball camera support.
- Keyboard, mouse, and gamepad support.
- Custom text rendering.
- Custom sprite rendering.
- A cache aware entity component system.
- A flexible  event/message passing system.

## Building
The solution is self contained. Simply download the entire project, open the solution file, and run in the debugger. Change scenes in SceneManager::Initialize.
